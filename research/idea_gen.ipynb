      "## Abstract\n",
      "This research aims to investigate the application of federated learning in healthcare, focusing on privacy-preserving techniques that can mitigate the risks associated with sensitive medical data. We will empirically evaluate the performance of various federated learning algorithms under limited computational resources and strict data privacy regulations, with the goal of identifying the most effective approach for healthcare applications.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Hypotheses\n",
      "1. Federated learning algorithms with differential privacy will outperform those without in terms of privacy preservation.\n",
      "2. The performance of federated learning algorithms will degrade with decreasing computational resources.\n",
      "3. Optimizing federated learning algorithms for healthcare applications will require a trade-off between accuracy and privacy preservation.\n",

      "1. Data collection and preprocessing\n",
      "2. Federated learning algorithm selection and implementation\n",
      "3. Experimental evaluation of algorithm performance\n",

      "## Experiments\n",
      "We will conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of different federated learning algorithms under varying computational resources and data privacy regulations.\n",
