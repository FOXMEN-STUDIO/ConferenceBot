      "**Strengths**:\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive Comparison**: The paper conducts a thorough comparison of different encoders and optimizers for the U-Net model, providing valuable insights into their performance.\n",
      "2. **Statistical Analysis**: The use of ANOVA to analyze the statistical significance of differences between optimizers is a strength, demonstrating a rigorous approach to evaluating performance metrics.\n",
      "3. **Clear Presentation of Results**: The inclusion of tables (like Table IV) and graphical representations (such as bar plots) helps in clearly benchmarking the performance of different methods.\n",

      "3. **Interpretation of Results**: The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion on the implications of the ANOVA results, especially considering the lack of statistically significant differences between optimizers.\n",

      "- **Results**: The presentation of results is clear, but additional analysis or discussion on why certain optimizers did not show statistically significant differences could provide deeper insights.\n",
      "- **Discussion**: This section is not provided, but it should interpret the results in the context of existing literature and discuss the implications of the findings.\n",
      "- **Conclusion**: Not available. It should summarize the main findings and suggest future directions based on the study’s outcomes.\n",

      "**Overall Recommendation**:\n",
      "Based on the provided excerpts, I would recommend **Major Revision**. The paper demonstrates a good foundation in terms of its experimental approach and analysis. However, to enhance its clarity, completeness, and impact, it needs to address the gaps in methodology description, include a comprehensive introduction and discussion, and ensure that all sections (including an abstract and conclusion) are well-integrated and effectively communicate the research’s significance and contributions.\n"
